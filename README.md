Financial Engineering: Portfolio Optimization
This project focuses on constructing an optimized portfolio using historical data from the S&P 500. The portfolio is designed to balance risk and return by minimizing risk or maximizing the Sharpe Ratio, considering various constraints and bounds.

The data collection process involved downloading historical adjusted closing prices for a set of chosen stocks from the S&P 500 index using Yahoo Finance. The selected stocks for this analysis are:
●	Apple Inc. (AAPL)

●	Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)

●	Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)

●	Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)

●	NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA)


Project Structure
The project is divided into several key steps:

1. Import Libraries and Install Dependencies
This section prepares the environment by importing necessary libraries and installing dependencies required for portfolio optimization.

2. Data Collection
The objective here is to retrieve historical price data for the S&P 500 index and its constituent stocks using the Yahoo Finance API. This data is essential for analyzing the performance of individual stocks and the overall index.

3. Data Preparation
In this step, the data is cleaned and prepared by calculating daily returns. This includes handling any missing data, ensuring that the dataset is ready for portfolio optimization.

4. Define Functions
Functions are defined to calculate key metrics such as portfolio return, portfolio risk (standard deviation), and the Sharpe Ratio. These functions are central to the optimization process.

5. Portfolio Optimization (Not yet detailed in the extracted cells)
The optimization process likely involves constructing a portfolio that minimizes risk or maximizes the Sharpe Ratio, depending on the objectives and constraints set by the user.

How to Run the Project
Install Dependencies: Ensure all necessary Python libraries are installed. This typically includes packages like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and yfinance.

Run the Notebook: Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially, starting from the import of libraries to the final portfolio optimization step.

Interpret Results: Analyze the outputs generated by the optimization functions to understand the performance of the constructed portfolio.
